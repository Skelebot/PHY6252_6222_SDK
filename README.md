# PHY6252_6222_SDK
PHY6252/6222 secondary development SDK. Modified for Ai-Thinker PB-03 module.
### This is my attempt at developing for the PHY6252 using open-source toolchains.
Keil ARM project files work.
GCC support unfinished - none of the examples work with GCC.

Contributions, tips or any kind of help are very welcome.
